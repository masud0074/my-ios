## Focus

I have two active spaces on my phone to minimize hand movement. Everything is optimized for reachability and partly aesthetics. I use dark mode most always on iOS. On macOS I tend to vary between light and dark themes preferring light theme.

iPhone for me is a consumption and communication device primarily. Everything I can do on the phone, I can do faster and better on [mac](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os). Thus I limit the kinds of activities I do on the phone and don't do things for long. Podcasts, chat, Twitter/Apollo/IG, photography..

## Applications

Here is a list of apps I use the most, sorted by category and their importance.

### Productivity

#### [2Do](https://www.2doapp.com/ios/) - Flexible task manager

- My task manager of choice. I [use tags to organize my tasks](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/2do) and work on tasks based on priority.

#### [Fantastical](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/fantastical-2-for-iphone/id718043190?mt=8) - Calendar

- Prefer it to stock calendar app due to a cleaner design and ability to add events quickly with natural language.

#### [Strong](https://www.strong.app/) - Workout tracker

- Use it to track my workouts. I have few custom workouts I made that I can start and simply follow the exercises and the number of sets for the exercise as my workout progresses. I most usually start and track my workouts with my [Apple Watch](#watchos) using [Streaks Workout](https://streaksworkout.com) to start bodyweight exercise workouts and Workouts to start cardio workouts (Running/Cycling).

#### [1Password](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password/id568903335?mt=8) - Password manager

- Can't live without the app. It holds all my passwords and anything private so that I only need to remember one thing. My master password. It seamlessly integrates with the OS so I can autofill saved passwords in seconds.

#### [Drive](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-drive/id507874739?mt=8) - Cloud Storage

- All my documents (files) are stored in iCloud. However Google Docs/Sheets are amazing tools for collaborating on documents.

#### [GitHub](https://github.com/mobile) - GitHub on the Go

- Use it respond or create issues on GitHub & keep up to date on activity of my watched repos.

#### [Wipr](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wipr/id1030595027) - Safari ad blocker

- Use the app to block annoying ads and tracking in Safari.

#### [Bobby](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bobby-track-subscriptions/id1059152023?mt=8)

- Use the app to track my ongoing subscriptions. I review it at the end of every month and [update my budget](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/economy/finance) for the month accordingly.

#### [Paprika](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paprika-recipe-manager-3/id1303222868?ls=1&mt=8) - Recipe manager

- I use the app to collect my favorite [plant based recipes](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/health/nutrition/recipes).

#### [Safari](https://www.apple.com/uk/safari/) - Browser

- One of the best features of Safari is fast access to bookmarks on opening of new tabs. Here are my top bookmarked sites I use:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/uDjnhwX.jpg" width="300" alt="img">

### Social

#### [Telegram](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/telegram-x/id898228810?mt=8) - Messenger

- My favorite messenger due its speed, its ability to sync with a native macOS client and the many free and awesome stickers you can use. I use Pocket to add links I want to check at some point in time. I also use Telegram Saved Messages and send messages to myself (links/quick-todos) that are of higher priority than Pocket. Adding quick todo to Telegram is much quicker than 2Do and it is assumed that the todo/note will be dealt with as soon as possible. I also use Saved Messages to share media between devices.

#### [Apollo](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apollo-for-reddit/id979274575?mt=8) - Reddit client

- My favorite client for browsing Reddit. I love how you can operate the app seamlessly with gestures. I also customized the app to work with my own gestures (i.e. swiping back & forth by initiating the swipe in the middle of the screen and not on the side).

#### [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com) - Mail client

- My favorite email client that I love due its simplicity of UI and UX as well as separation of emails based on their type (Inbox, newsletters).

#### [Slack](https://itunes.apple.com/app/slack-team-communication/id618783545) - Team communication

- Only keep essential teams I am signed up on there.

### Photos

#### [Photos](http://www.apple.com/lae/ios/photos/) - Photo library

- The place for all my personal photos/videos synced with iCloud. I love its Memories features.

#### [Darkroom](https://darkroom.co) - Photo & video editor

- Use it to quickly edit photographs I made as prefer its filters and editing options than other photo editors.

#### [Slidebox](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slidebox-photo-manager/id984305203?mt=8) - Photo & Album Organizer

- Use the app to quickly delete bad photos and sort photos into albums quickly. I try have all the photos in my Photos library be placed in some folder and this app lets me easily do that.

#### [Instagram](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252?mt%3D8) - Photo sharing

- Love it as a way to [share my life](https://www.instagram.com/nikitavoloboev/) through photographs, videos and stories.

### Learn

#### [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) - Podcasts

- Lets me listen to the plethora of [podcasts I love](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/podcasts). I love its [smart speed](https://medium.com/@eped/overcasts-smart-speed-vs-real-time-a759549ab48b#.f05tiojfo) feature to cut out on silent pauses.

#### [Audible](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/audible-audio-books-podcasts/id379693831?mt=8) - Audiobooks

- If I am not listening to a podcast or relaxing by playing music, I listen to books.

#### [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/ios/) - RSS Reeder

- Use the app to read through my [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com) feeds of [blogs I follow](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/research/blogs).

#### [Books](https://www.apple.com/ibooks/)

- Use it to read books (PDF & EPUB). And listen to audio books I downloaded that Audible doesn't have.

#### [V for Wiki](http://v-for-wiki.com) - Wiki reader

- Amazing and beautiful Wikipedia reader. The typography of it and the design makes you explore and easily get lost in reading the wiki.

### Write

#### [Ulysses](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225571038?mt=8) - Writing

- I use the app to make edits to my [wiki](https://wiki.nikiv.dev). Since the wiki is a bunch of markdown files in a folder that I keep on Dropbox, I can add that folder to Ulysses as external folder and make edits to it.

### Music

#### [Spotify](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spotify-music/id324684580?mt=8) - Music streaming

- Love using it due to superior music recommendation, UI/UX and social features like [playlist sharing](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/music/music-playlists) .

### Travel

#### [Google Maps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps-transit-food/id585027354?mt=8) - GPS, City Navigation & Traffic

- Use it as my main navigation app and a travel guide. Collect [lists of places I want to visit and places I loved seeing](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/travel/visited).

### Automation

#### [Scriptable](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188?mt=8) - Automation using JavaScript

- Lets you write JavaScript code and combine it with Siri Shortcuts. Can even [edit the code on the mac](https://talk.automators.fm/t/code-editing-on-the-mac/2005) and instantly run the shortcuts on the phone. Plan to learn how to use it well to write more sophisticated shortcuts.

## Widgets

Here are the widgets I use:

I use `Test` shortcut to prototype new actions/ideas quickly. I then duplicate the working prototype & give it appropriate name. I use the same prototyping idea with [KM macros](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros).

## Control Center

Here is how my control center looks:

    <img width="250" heigth="400" src="https://i.imgur.com/JFxssYt.jpg"></a>

## WatchOS

I use Apple Watch as a way to track my health and fitness and view useful information at a glance like current time and events.

<a align="center" href="https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios">
    <img width="250" heigth="400" src="https://i.imgur.com/qzFn7Ot.jpg"></a>

I use only one Infograph Modular watch face. It shows the current time and day, the weather and my current or future calendar events (with [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)). It also lets me quickly start cardio workout (running/biking) or bodyweight workout (with [Streaks Workout](https://streaksworkout.com)). I can also start a timer or see the time of a timer if one is already running.

## iPad

I mostly use my iPad for drawing with [Procreate](https://procreate.art) or noting/sketching in [Notes](https://www.icloud.com/notes)/[Muse](https://museapp.com/) with Apple Pencil. Or playing [Chess](https://lichess.org/) / [Wild Rift](https://wildrift.leagueoflegends.com/). I also sometimes use it as second screen with [Sidecar](https://support.apple.com/en-me/HT210380).

## Games

I prefer using PS5 for playing games as the games there are much better. Some games I do play on iPad are:

- [Lichess](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lichess-online-chess/id968371784)
- [Hearthstone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hearthstone/id625257520)
