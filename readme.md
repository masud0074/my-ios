## Applications

This is extension of [my macOS overview](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac). Best read it first as many apps below I use on mac too and describe in more detail there.

I only use 2 active spaces on my phone without any folders to minimize hand movement. Everything is optimized for reachability and partly aesthetics. I nearly always use dark mode as I prefer it unless I am outside and it's hard to read the text.

iOS for me is a consumption and communication device primarily so I try to offload heavy busy work to macOS.

I minimize push notifications I actually receive to only messaging apps. Mostly just [Telegram](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/telegram). Everything else I have to go inside the apps to check what's new so as to not distract me from day to day life. I also keep it on Do Not Disturb nearly always too. Especially when I work on my mac and keep the phone on the side so as to not duplicate notifications.

### Productivity

- [Fantastical](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/fantastical) use to manage my calendar and events. I like their widget to show my current schedule of the day.
- [2Do](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/2do) for personal tasks. Want to move away from it as the current sync takes too long sadly. But the mac 2Do app is unmatched currently.
- [1Password](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/1password) use it whenver I need to find some specific secret file like Passport photo or details.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/mobile) don't use often but is nice when I need to reply to an urgent issue.
- [Wipr](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wipr/id1030595027) - Safari ad blocker. Works well.
- [Safari](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/web/browsers/safari) absolutely love it for reading and opening pages. Works fast. I like keeping [top used sites in bookmarks bar](https://i.imgur.com/uDjnhwX.jpg) so I can open them fast.

### Social

- [Telegram](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/telegram) use it chat and read groups. Want to start using it more heavily by creating specialized bots.
- [Apollo](https://apolloapp.io/) love the client and its custom gestures (like swiping back & forth by initiating the swipe in the middle of the screen and not on the side).
- [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com) use it to check on mail. I don't have notifications set for email.
- [Slack](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/slack) & [Discord](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/discord) to check up on communities I am in.

### Photos

- [Photos](http://www.apple.com/lae/ios/photos/) does good job of managing and searching for photos I need. I have few albums I made for myself to make finding things easier too. Love its Memories feature and use the Photos Widget to remind myself of the past photos I took or saved.
- [VSCO](https://www.vsco.co/) & [Darkroom](https://darkroom.co) for photo editing. Don't pay for VSCO as it's quite expensive but they both do a good job at editing photos.
- [Slidebox](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slidebox-photo-manager/id984305203?mt=8) use it to quickly clean up photos, especially duplicates or bad takes.
- [Instagram](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/social-networks/instagram) not a fan of how many ads IG pushes to the feeds/stories but I do love content of many accounts there so I still use it. Share some [photos and stories of my life](https://www.instagram.com/nikitavoloboev/) in there.

### Learn

- [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) use it to listen to [podcasts I like](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/podcasts). I love its [smart speed](https://medium.com/@eped/overcasts-smart-speed-vs-real-time-a759549ab48b#.f05tiojfo) feature to cut out on silent pauses.
- [Audible](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/audible-audio-books-podcasts/id379693831?mt=8) listen to audio books there.
- [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) I do nearly all the reading of [RSS](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/web/rss) on the mac.
- [Books](https://www.apple.com/ibooks/) use it to read some books. It recently added a nice [digital narration](https://authors.apple.com/support/4519-digital-narration-audiobooks).
- [V for Wiki](http://v-for-wiki.com) love exploring wikipedia when I am bored. This is nice app for doing this. Typography in it is great.

### Music

- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) use it to stream all [my music](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/music).

### Travel

- [Google Maps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps-transit-food/id585027354?mt=8) use it as my main navigation app and a travel guide. Collect [lists of places I want to visit and places I loved seeing](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/travel/visited).

### Automation

- [Scriptable](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188?mt=8) don't use it much but want to.

## Widgets

Here are the widgets I use:

I use `Test` shortcut to prototype new actions/ideas quickly. I then duplicate the working prototype & give it appropriate name. I use the same prototyping idea with [KM macros](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros).

## Control Center

Here is how my control center looks:

## WatchOS

I actually stopped wearing a watch. But when I did I mostly used it to track my health and fitness and view useful information at a glance like current time and events.

<a align="center" href="https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios">
    <img width="250" heigth="400" src="https://i.imgur.com/qzFn7Ot.jpg"></a>

I used only one Infograph Modular watch face. It shows the current time and day, the weather and my current or future calendar events (with [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)). It also lets me quickly start cardio workout (running/biking) or bodyweight workout (with [Streaks Workout](https://streaksworkout.com)). I can also start a timer or see the time of a timer if one is already running.

## iPad

I mostly use my iPad for drawing with [Procreate](https://procreate.art) or noting/sketching in [Notes](https://www.icloud.com/notes)/[Muse](https://museapp.com/) with Apple Pencil. I also sometimes use it as second screen with [Sidecar](https://support.apple.com/en-me/HT210380).

## Games

I prefer using PS5 for playing [games](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/games) as the games there are much better. Some games I rarely play on iPad are:

- [Lichess](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lichess-online-chess/id968371784)
- [Wild Rift](https://apps.apple.com/app/league-of-legends-wild-rift/id1480616990)

If you found this interesting, I also have a [similar repository](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac) going over what applications I use on macOS.
